# pyTyping by 18Stels
Typing text at speed for the site (sample: ratatype.com; ratatype.ru;)

1. If new texts appear, run SparsText.py and specify the path to the folder where you can create a text document.
2. After all the texts are downloaded, install the pyautogui library (pip install pyautogui).
3. Next, open the file stels.py , and post the text you are interested in from the site "ratatype". (In the "Text" section.)
4. Open stels.py and click on the site "start testing". After that, press the  key for start text.
5. Congratulations, you have coped with typing in 2 seconds, you have typed 999 characters. 
(To change the number of characters per minute, change the speed write line. Less number means more speed. And vice versa). Good luck.
